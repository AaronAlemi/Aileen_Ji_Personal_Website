        <div class="subtext">Zookeeper: Optimal Path Finder <br>
            Implemented Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithm to minimize cost of constructing paths between enclosures.
            Constructed a fast and effective TSP Branch and Bound algorithm that always produces the optimal canal routes through all exhibits. <br>
            Routing Scheme Algorithm <br>
            Developed two routing algorithms using stack and queue containers,
            conducted BFS and DFS to find the optimal pathway,
            designed command line argument processor which handles different flags and options,
            and utilized test-driven development and Makefiles to automate testing and running software <br>
            Forum Post Classifier <br>
            Created a machine learning program that uses natural language processing to automatically identify the subject of 10,000+ posts, 
            implemented BST and Map data structures to efficiently store and search for elements <br>
            Programming languages: C++, C, Java, Python, Julia, HTML/CSS/Javascript
